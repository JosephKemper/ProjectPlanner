I will need a data structure to represent both a project and a task. 

## Task Data Structure

The Task data structure will need to manage the following pieces of data. 
Task name - String
Task description - String
Due date - Date
Start date - Date
Complete - Boolean
Status - type Status (custom designed data structure designed to only have a selected number of statuses to choose from)

## Status Data Structure

Will define the available statuses for a project/task to be in. Right now, those are as follows:
On Time
Delayed
Need Help
Waiting on info

# Project Data Structure

Will define all parts that are used within a project. 
Project name - String
Project description - String
Due date - date
Start date - date
Complete - boolean
Status - type Status (custom designed data structure designed to only have a selected number of statuses to choose from)
