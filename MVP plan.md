## General Concepts

Build a console based task manager. For now, don't worry about building it as a graphical task manger. I can add that later. I have a lot to learn about building the front end side of things anyway. I want to start with an idea, this will have a name for the idea and a description. From there, once a project is attached to the idea, it will become a goal. Both projects and goals can have individual target dates set for them. Projects can then have tasks added to them. Ideas, goals, projects, and tasks can have notes added to them. 
I want the ability to display a goal and all of its attached projects, along with all of the related tasks. I also want the ability to see just the goals, projects, or tasks. I want to build an idea list, this will be a list of ideas that can eventually be turned into goals. All that needs to happen to turn an idea into a goal is to add a project to it. Goals, projects, and tasks will all have due dates, current status tracking, and the ability to add notes. Obviously, I will need the ability to create, edit, and delete goals, projects, and tasks. I want the task manager to automatically show a list of the next few tasks, projects, and goals that are due. It will also show any overdue goals, projects, or tasks that are overdue.
