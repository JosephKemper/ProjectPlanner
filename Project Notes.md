I would want the tool to be able to be used every step of the way from project inception to completion. 
Enable easy submission of ideas for potential projects. Will be software development focused. 
Multiple user levels, 
I want private access to projects for authorized users, while still allowing anyone to be able to submit an idea. I specifically want private citizens to be able to submit ideas for projects, while keeping active projects hidden from anyone who is not authorized. 
Once an idea is submitted, there will be a standard review process for the idea that will be able to ideally be completed within a few minutes. From there, I want the ability to change the status of the idea to a different status. 

Once the project gets into production, it will have the ability to break a project into smaller portions, and even sub sections, ultimately getting down to the class level, where the program will have the ability to fill in the template for a class dynamically. 

I want the ability to generate UML diagrams from the code. 

Idea List
The ideas list, is just that, a list to store ideas for new projects, or new ways to improve existing projects. It is a place to add new ideas of any kind to in an attempt to encourage more ideas to be generated. The idea behind adding them all to one place is to help encourage more ideas to be generated. 

New ideas will initially be added to a list. If the idea is about how to improve an existing project, then it will have a tag that will connect it to that project. 
Each new idea will have 3 options to select from 
	1. Review
	2. Thinking about
	3. Pass

Review will move the idea to the Review stage
Thinking about will temporarily hid it from the list, but will add it back into the list after the current session has ended. 
Pass, will remove it from the active ideas list, and put it into the scrapped ideas list. 

Scrapped Ideas
The purpose behind the Scrapped Ideas list is that while an idea might be a bad idea, at one point, in another circumstance, it might be a great idea. So, instead of deleting the ideas permanently from the database, we can move them to an out of the way area that will let us go back to when we want to find more ideas to build. And Even if we are certain that an idea might never be viable, keeping it around to review later, might get us ideas that are viable. 

The Scrapped ideas list, will have two primary options, and one sub option that will be accessed through a menu button. 
	1. Review
	2. Pass
	3. (hidden in menu) Delete

Review will move the idea to the Review stage
Pass will temporarily remove the idea from the list, but will add it back into the list after the current session has ended. 
Delete will permanently remove the idea from the program. 

Idea Review
Review will have a basic template to use to review the idea with and can be customized for each company. The concept behind this phase of the project is that the ideas will be reviewed for feasibility, whether it meets the company goals, whether it has a market, and other concepts. It will have places to store notes, attach documents of varying types, and will be formatted to allow for easy presentation and review. The goal of the Idea Review stage is to create a uniform idea review process that will let the company quickly and easily review new ideas to determine if they can or should be moved to production. 

Upon completion of the review process, an idea will either be approved, rejected, or put on hold. Any action taken must have a thorough and well thought out reason for why the status was given to it. 

If approved the idea moves to the pre project phase. 
If rejected, then it gets moved to the Researched Idea list, where it will stay until revisited. 
The Pending status means that while right now is not a good time for the idea, a specific date can be seen in the future for when we could launch the project. 

Project Design
This stage is where the idea gets fleshed out and turned into a product. It is where potential features get listed out and mockups get built. It will have places to add explanations and images for the project. Upon being marked complete, the project moves to Algorithm Design. 

Algorithm Design
In this stage the algorithm that will guide the programming of the project will be designed. Upon completion, the project will be moved to UML design. 

UML Design
This stage will have the initial classes and functions of the program designed at a high level and will build out the UML diagrams for the various parts of the program. At this point, the project will be broken down into smaller sections. As each class and function is designed, can be individually assigned and programmed. 

Building Project
Coding out the project including building out the UI to the project. After this the project is released and goes into maintenance phase. 

Maintenance
As long the product continues to be supported, it will have regularly scheduled maintenance performed where any bugs will be fixed and where new ideas will be researched and staged for review.
