# Software Goals
The goal of this project is to build a project planner that I will use in my future projects I build with TechFirst. I also want to experiment with the use of multiple languages and to showcase my skills as a programmer. Accordingly, I will be planning out the algorithm for my program, and then building it simultaneously in Python, JavaScript, C#, and Kotlin.
